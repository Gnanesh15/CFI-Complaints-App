CFI - Complaints App

   This is a mobile app built using Flutter framework that records special complaints and services needed regarding waste disposal. This app is a project under Center For Innovation (CFI), IITM. 

Intuition behind the App - 

•	From the recent years there has been a huge need for the sustainability of our environment. One of the biggest challenges that our country is facing is regarding disposal of all sorts of waste materials, both bio-degradable and non-bio degradable.

•	Taken under the National Green Tribunal (NGT) directives, this is an app made to connect all the people with organizations like OWZONE and Engineering Control Unit so that people can register complaints which will directly be solved by the organizations in a faster way.

Functioning – 

•	This App is a free source available to everyone. Once a user downloads the app, he/she needs to register for a new account using his/her email ID and create a new password. The existing users can directly login using his/her credentials.

•	When this is done, the user will be directed to the home page which displays all the registered complaints made by the user.  A ‘+’ sign at bottom of the screen is the button for registering a new complaint.

•	On clicking it, the user will be directed to a new screen where he/she needs to enter title of complaint and then add an image regarding that. There is no upper bound on the number of images being added. Then they can click on submit to register the complaint. Empty fields or any other invalid data is taken care by the app.

•	Finally the registered complaint will be shown on the home screen for the user and the same will be sent to the organizations for the necessary action. 

   This is an effective app that is highly needed in public areas like college institutions where there are more people as informing the staff responsible for cleaning becomes a big process. This app is will currently be used by the students and the residents of IITM and later will be available to residents outside IITM. 

   This uploaded dart code is the prototype of the app. Updates for the app are going to be uploaded here.
